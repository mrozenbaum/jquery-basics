Preparation:

// Problem: It looks unattractive in smaller browser widths and small devices.
// Solution: Hide the text links, and swap them out for a more appropiate navigation.

Plan:

Plan on how we're going to solve the problem by writing some pseudo-code.

// Ceate a <select> and append to menu
// Cycle over menu links
// Create an <option>
// Option value is the href
// Options text is the text of link
// Append option to select
// Create <button>
// Bind click to button 
// Go to selects location  
// Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select
// Also hides select and button on larger width and shows links
// Deal with selected options, depending on current page
